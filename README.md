# How to use Brave CMS

I have created a simple installation process: after creating a database and providing credentials (the appropriate values for `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`) in the `.env` file (placed in the root directory), you can run the `Install` controller which will create all the necessary tables.

After that, you will be invited to *sign up*. After a successful sign-up, because you are the *first user*, you will be given the role of `super-admin`.

You will be able to sign in and write articles, add or delete categories, etc.
